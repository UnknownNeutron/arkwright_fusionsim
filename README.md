Welcome to my Arkwright Engineering Scholarship project! This is a simulator for the nuclear fusion inside a tokamak, aimed at A-Level/Undergrad students.

More information about this can be found in docs\OVERVIEW.md and the main code resides in src\
The folder tests\ bears prototype snippets of code, and versions\ holds previous releases

I STRONGLY reccomend checking this project in VScode or another proper editor to see appropriate markdown formatting (e.g. three hashtags for notes that stand out)
